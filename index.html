    Dear Omi,<br><br>
    I don’t really know when it happened. One day I was keeping my usual distance, and the next, I was in the middle of all this chaos with you and the others. I never meant to get attached — but I did.
   I’ve always been someone who prefers staying just far enough to not get too attached. But somehow, in between the chaotic hangouts, dumb jokes, and our jam session, I got pulled into something which I haven't in a long time.

I tried to avoid hangouts at first. I remember getting guilt tripped by Pengu and Togrik into watching Sikkander, because last time a movie show was apparently canceled since I didn’t show up. And after some terrible attempt to avoid hangouts by me, you somehow convinced me to join you all. I thought that would be the end of it.  But then came the project, when you suddenly asked if you could use my room to shoot your film. I don’t usually let people into my space, but somehow you all barged in and For a few days, my room was full of movement, jokes, bad takes, and somehow there was also comfort.

Even though the final file got corrupted, it didn’t really matter because the experience is whats stuck with me for the rest of my life. The feeling of being part of something chaotic and imperfect but still very special.

I don’t say this out loud often, but I’ve learned the hard way that good things don’t last just because they feel like they should. Everything, friendships, moments, people can fall apart if you stop caring, stop trying. That’s why I cared a lot about our little group and did everything I did. So, If I ever seemed distant know it wasn’t because I didn’t value what we have.

You’re moving on to something new, and that’s how it should be, growth can feel uncomfortable or uncertain much like stepping out of your shell, and that is completely fine. But I hope when you think of this time, of us - this strange, unhinged, accidentally close little group- you remember it as something that mattered. Even if it was brief. Because
It did. To me, it really did.

And if we drift, that’s okay too. Because I’ll still smile when I hear our recordings, or when I think about you two singing gospel while I tried to keep up on the keyboard. I'll hold on to that joy, however brief it was.

Please never feel like a burden or a lost cause for taking a gap year, everybody has their own pace and you are doing better than most people , being aware of what  you are going to do once you reach home. 

I am rooting for you all the way. I wish you All the best for your anchoring programme, All the best for your teaching experience, All the best if you ever open that boutique you told us about , and All the best for every unexpected opportunities that heads your way.

You've got this. And I'm grateful to be part of this story. <br><br>
    With warmest wishes,
  </div>

  <div class="kanji">さようなら</div>

  <div class="message">Thank you for everything. We will miss you.</div>
